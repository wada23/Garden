    <h1>welcome to the jungle</h1>

    <p>hello, welcome to this cute webpage that i am curently working on. 
        I am learning the famous Java Script because that is how I would like to win some money 
        in the future - by working on a computer. That will be great even though people 
        say it is not worth while the AI is taking over. I do not care what people say anymore. 
        Nobody actually cares about anybody but themselves right. 
        What ever. Now this can easily become kind of a diary for me, hm. 
        The only problem is that it is kind of online so anybody could read this. But after all who cares,
        and who cares to read this shit anyway. Well that is all for today so have a great day and good bye. 
        Love. adela. 
    </p>
